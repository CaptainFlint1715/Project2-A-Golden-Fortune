# Project2-A-Golden-Fortune
We undertook this project with the goal of creating a choose-your-own adventure story game set in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy. Our user story was:
As a lover of games and immersive storytelling,
I want to expereince a choose-your-own adventure game that provides replay value with multiple branching paths,
so that I can enjoy learning about history while having fun over the course of many playthroughs.
We utilized express.js, node.js, handlebars.js, and mysql to build a RESTful API with a database to manage scenes, choices, and character actions through each adventure session.
